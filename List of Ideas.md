1. Look into some programs to run automatically when a torrent is finished downloading. If I can pass the tag/cat info to the program i could use it to auto sort the files when they're done. or even just stripping them of their folder when it's a TV episode but not a movie or TV Season. 

1. Learn LaTeX. It will be helpful for reformating the resume and cover letter in a non binary format which will be super useful for git

1. GIMP Scripting - Script-Fu as seen on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ZRJnAhmeU can be pretty useful. Perhaps I should learn some scriptfu to do some common thing I do in gimp like adding center guides. I do that all the time it would nice to do it in a single cick rather than 7. 

1. GIMP annoyance - by default snap to edge is off and I'd like it to default on. i need it on more often than not.

1. Use [Appraise](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/d74u3y/apprise_push_notifications_that_work_with_just/) to send notifications. Should be useful in some of the automation stuff. No ideas yet but this could be useful

1. Perhaps I should start a list of just interesting sources

1. Install Visual Studio Code as seen in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApbdhcZBcyU) tutorial it should be pretty useful

1. use rsync and rclone to create a encrypted dropbox storage. Maybe start by storing ebooks there.
